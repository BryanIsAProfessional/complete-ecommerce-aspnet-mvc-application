# Sample ASP.NET MVC Project

This project is a sample of my C# development skills using the ASP.NET framework and MVC design patterns, as well as Microsoft SQL Server. The core of the project is from [Ervis Trupja's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBkA5_DaasQ&list=PL2Q8rFbm-4ruTcZY39MNOsEu4p76HQ5VX), and is not particularly impressive on its own. I intend to improve on this project until it gets me a job. All the relevant implemented changes should be well documented here, as well as commented in code, and summarized in their respective commit.

## Tutorial Features

The tutorial that this is based off of is the first half of a [paid course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-ecommerce-aspnet-mvc-application/?referralCode=51D745ED2E5C66DB498F) that I do not have access to, but it does give me a built-in roadmap of features:

 - [ ] Controllers for all models
 - [ ] Shopping cart and orders
 - [ ] PayPal integration
 - [ ] User accounts
 - [ ] Authentication
 - [ ] Full Deployment

## Additional Features

I'm implementing these features to emulate working on a real website in a professional environment as best as I can.

 - [ ] Comprehensive data validation
 - [ ] Testing
 - [ ] CI/CD pipeline
 - [ ] Algorithmic improvements to searches
 - [ ] Redesigned User Interface
    - The original UI is serviceable, but not an example of my work.
 - [ ] Security Precautions
    - Not my focus, so probably just basic SQL injection defenses
